# In love with art of "Scientific Communication"

I can never forget my first introduction to the beauty of scientific writing. I had submitted a half-cooked, four-page conference paper, thinking it was a masterpiece, until my professor corrected and reshaped it into a form I could barely recognize. I was particularly amazed at how the results and discussion sections were revised—I had completely skipped the latter, ignorant of its necessity. **Ever since, I have fallen in love with the art of scientific communication**. With each new article, I would use wonderfully written papers as benchmarks and sources of inspiration, striving to improve compared to my earlier works.

My best times during my PhD were always accompanied by a cup of coffee, a writing partner, late-night sessions, and the sound of keys clicking away as the paper progressed toward completion.

 **I now take pleasure in sharing the insights** and nuances I’ve gathered with budding writers, offering guidance on effective articulation techniques for their journals, theses, and reports.

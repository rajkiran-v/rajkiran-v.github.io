# Short Abstract

This work addresses the need for a **currently non-existent device** that facilitates **multifaceted assessment of vascular health markers** for identifying the cumulative burden of risk factors early on and the extent of **vascular aging** for effective prediction of **future cardiovascular events**. 

Consequently, **A-mode ultrasound methods** and a device for assessing the structural and functional properties of an artery —including **Lumen Diameter**, **Intima-Media Thickness (IMT)**, **Local and Carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)**, and **central Blood Pressure (BP)**—were developed and validated. 

This device has demonstrated several **clear advantages**, including:  

1. **Facilitating an affordable and compact design**, making it accessible for wider use.  
2. **Minimizing processing overhead**, enhancing operational efficiency.  
3. **Enabling online measurement and visual feedback**, improving usability and real-time diagnostics. 
4. **Reducing dependence on the operator**, ensuring more consistent results.  
5. **Allowing multiple markers to be examined on a single device**, streamlining vascular health assessment.

# Motivation

## **Introduction: The Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)**
- **Global Impact**: CVDs are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with cases rising to 523 million and deaths increasing to 18.6 million between 1990 and 2019.
- **Premature Mortality**: One-third of CVD deaths occur prematurely (ages 30–60), undermining global health and development goals.
- **Geographical Trends**: CVD prevalence is surging in low- and middle-income countries, while high-income regions are seeing a concerning re-rise in CVD cases.

## **Existing Challenges in Prevention**
- **Current Strategies**: Prevention primarily focuses on behavioral risk factor reduction and population-level risk scoring models.
- **Limitations of Traditional Risk Scores**:
  - **Population-Based Design**: Effective for populations but lack precision for individuals.
  - **Overlook Early Risks**: Struggle to predict risk in young, asymptomatic individuals or consider age-related interactions.
  - **Exclusion of Non-Traditional Factors**: Ignoring subclinical markers and personalized risk insights limits effectiveness.

## **The Paradigm Shift: Early Vascular Aging (EVA)**
- **Concept of Vascular Aging (VA)**: Reflects the cumulative damage to arteries due to aging and external stressors, varying among individuals.
- **Early Detection Imperative**: EVA focuses on identifying vascular damage in its early stages to enable timely interventions, especially for at-risk youth and asymptomatic individuals.
- **Experts’ Opinion**: A global survey by VascAgeNet (213 participants from 39 countries) revealed that 62% emphasized the importance of EVA assessment, yet only 14% integrate it into clinical practice.

- **Unaddressed Needs**: Tools to assess vascular health markers are needed to move from population-level predictions to individualized care.

## **Way-forward**
Given the limitations of conventional approaches, there is an urgent need for:
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Shift focus from risk factors to vascular damage evaluation.
- **Scalable Solutions**: Develop affordable and accessible diagnostic methods for early detection.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Improve risk stratification and enable individualized prevention strategies for effective CVD control.

# Current Gap

## **Survey Insights from VascAgeNet**
- **Low Clinical Adoption**: Despite its recognized importance, EVA assessment is rarely integrated into routine clinical practice (~13% adoption rate).
- **Primary Barriers**:
  - Limited automated technologies for EVA measurement.
  - Expensive devices, making them unsuitable for routine use.
  - Independent devices for each measurand, leading to fragmented assessments.
  - Lack of field-deployable devices for diverse or resource-limited settings.

## **Limitations of Existing Tools**
- **Fragmented Approach**:
  - EVA relies on diverse markers like cfPWV, IMT, FMD, CBP, and MRI, but there’s no consensus on the most effective combination.
  - Assessments often require multiple devices and significant technical expertise.
- **Barriers to Scalability**:
  - Time-consuming procedures unsuitable for large-scale studies.
  - Limited utility in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

## **Call for Technological Advancement**
- **Integrated Solutions Needed**:
  - A single, cost-effective, automated device capable of multimodal assessment.
  - Scalable and field-deployable for diverse clinical and research applications.
- **Potential Impact**:
  - Simplified, comprehensive assessments combining structural and functional arterial properties.
  - Enabling personalized vascular-age scores for enhanced cardiovascular risk management.

# Scope and Objectives of Research

## **Context and Motivation**
- **Importance of Comprehensive Measurement**: Simultaneously assessing key vascular health markers—wall geometry, regional and local arterial stiffness, and CBP—is critical for understanding and monitoring Early Vascular Aging (EVA).
- **Current Technology Gaps**:
  - No single device integrates the measurement of all critical vascular aging markers.
  - Existing ultrasound-based techniques address some markers but fall short of comprehensive coverage.
  - Conventional systems, primarily image-based (B-mode, M-mode, Doppler-mode), rely on high-cost, non-portable equipment requiring trained personnel.
  - Advanced imaging features like ultrafast imaging, necessary for certain markers, are absent in entry-level systems.

## **Potential of A-Mode Ultrasound Systems**
- **Advantages of A-Mode Ultrasound**:
  1. Significantly reduced computational load.
  2. Supports high-speed ultrasound applications and multimodal sensor integration.
  3. Enables affordable, portable, and field-deployable solutions.
- **Existing Limitations**:
  - Current literature lacks robust methods for integrating vital vascular health marker assessments in A-mode systems.
  - Existing techniques are often non-robust and incompatible with the simplified architecture of A-mode systems.

## **Scope of Research**
- **Advancing State-of-the-Art**:
  - Develop methods and systems based on A-mode ultrasound that match or exceed existing state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and robustness.
- **Addressing Instrumentation Challenges**:
  - Resolve key challenges in the measurement of individual vascular parameters (shown in below table).

## Research Objectives

- **Arterial Wall Tracking**: Develop a reliable method to identify and track arterial wall locations from A-mode ultrasound scans.
- **Geometeric Mearsurements**: Automate the measurement of key arterial metrics—lumen diameter, IMT, and their variations throughout the cardiac cycle.
- **High-Frame-Rate System Design**: Create a high-frame-rate (~1 kHz) multimodal system for dual-channel A-mode ultrasound and pressure signal acquisition, including compact sensor probes.
- **Local PWV Measurement**: Implement real-time methods to measure local pulse wave velocity (PWV) and its intra-cardiac variations using the developed system.
- **Regional Stiffness Measurement**: Extend the system to assess regional arterial stiffness (cfPWV) in addition to local stiffness.
- **Central Blood Pressure Estimation**: Develop a calibration-free approach to evaluate central blood pressure (CBP) using structural properties and local PWV, and validate the system’s ability to track physiological fluctuations.

This research aims to fill the technological gaps in EVA assessment by creating a simplified, affordable, and comprehensive A-mode ultrasound solution, addressing both clinical and field-based applications.

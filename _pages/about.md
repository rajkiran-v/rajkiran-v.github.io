## Short Biography

Dr. Raj Kiran V received his Ph.D. from the Electrical Engineering Department of the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/), where he was honored with the **Best Interdisciplinary Thesis award** at the institute level.

Currently, he serves as a **Principal Scientist** in the cardiovascular division of the Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre [(HTIC – IIT Madras)](https://www.hticiitm.org/). With over a decade of experience in **R&D** and two years in **Product Development**, he specializes in biomedical technologies within the cardiovascular domain. Over the years, he has collaborated with clinicians and researchers from multiple healthcare centers to address **real-world biomedical challenges** in vascular health assessment. His scientific contributions are evident in the scope and quality of his work, which includes **over 80 peer-reviewed publications** and **30+ filed patents (7 granted)**

His expertise spans several critical areas, including **advanced signal processing, biomedical instrumentation, vascular biomechanics, vascular aging pathways**, and **novel ultrasound imaging technologies**. This diverse skill set enables him to excel as an architect, innovator, and developer of groundbreaking biomedical solutions. He is passionate about transforming healthcare accessibility by creating **affordable solutions** and advocating for **preventive and primordial care**.

## Philosophy and Vision

I firmly believe that **indigenous problems demand indigenous solutions**, particularly in a developing country like India.

India’s medical device market, valued at approximately **$15 billion as of 2023–2024**, relies heavily on imports, with **70–80% of devices sourced from abroad**. These include high-end technologies like imaging systems and diagnostic tools. However, the reliance on imports inflates costs due to customs duties, logistics, and foreign exchange rates, inadvertently limiting access to affordable healthcare for a vast majority of the population. Alarmingly, only **20% of the population can afford essential medical care during illness**, which underscores the need for innovative, tailored solutions **to bridge gaps in accessibility and affordability, which is my vision**.

As a technologist, I understand my role extends far beyond the confines of translational research. To make a tangible impact, I expose myself to the **full spectrum of product development**, from understanding the nuances of **regulatory compliance** to successfully launching products into the market. This holistic approach enables me to bridge the gap between innovative ideas and practical solutions that address real-world challenges.

This philosophy shaped my doctoral research and continues to drive my post-PhD endeavors. From **2023 to 2024**, I led the **technology and product development activities for [ARTSENS® Plus](https://artsens.tech/leadership)**, a portable, image-free ultrasound technology designed for comprehensive vascular health assessment. As one of the key contributions of my [Ph.D. thesis][2], this affordable device uniquely measures: **Local carotid artery stiffness**, **Aortic pulse wave velocity**, **Central and** ,**Brachial blood pressures**, all in a single test —capabilities unmatched in the current market.

Beyond my technology translation role within the team, I have embraced regulatory affairs, successfully managing compliance for ARTSENS® Plus and completing the necessary documentation for both **FDA 510(k)** and **CDSCO submissions** within a year.

While **translational research** is my core passion, these experiences have been pivotal in expanding my understanding of the **nuances of product development, regulatory frameworks, and market dynamics**—essential steps in transforming innovative ideas into impactful solutions.

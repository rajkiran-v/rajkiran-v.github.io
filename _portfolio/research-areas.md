Below is snapshot of the major themes of focus shaping my research.

---

### 1. **Early Vascular Aging (EVA) and Preventive Cardiovascular Health**

**Focus**: Shifting cardiovascular care from reactive to preventive by identifying vascular aging before symptoms appear.
> _Early Vascular Aging (EVA) represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular risk assessment — from population-level scoring to the detection of subclinical vascular damage. My work enables personalized cardiovascular profiling by measuring early markers such as endothelial dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, and atherosclerosis, particularly in young or asymptomatic individuals. This supports timely, individualized interventions for long-term cardiovascular health._

### 2. **Multimodal Cardiovascular Health Assessment**

**Focus**: Integrating structural and functional arterial markers to holistically evaluate vascular burden.
> _Cardiovascular risk is multifactorial and cannot be captured through isolated metrics. I design systems that unify multiple arterial health indicators and sensing modalities into a single, streamlined framework. These platforms measure FMD, IMT, lumen diameter, central BP, and both local and regional stiffness — all within a single test — enhancing diagnostic precision and applicability in both clinical and field environments._

### 3. **Affordable and Advanced Ultrasound Technologies**

**Focus**: Designing high-speed, affordable, and compact edge-systems for ultrasound-based vascular monitoring.
> _A-mode ultrasound offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional imaging systems. I have developed multichannel, multimodal A-mode platforms capable of high-speed acquisition (∼10 kFps), enabling capture of fine vessel dynamics. These systems are optimized for advanced applications like local PWV measurement and arterial hyperelasticity modeling, and are well-suited for real-time use in resource-constrained environments._

### 4. **Advanced Signal Processing applications**

**Focus**: Extracting clinically relevant information from raw sensor signals in real-time.
> _I apply advanced signal processing to extract robust physiological features from diverse modalities such as radiofrequency ultrasound, blood pulse waveforms, ECG, EMG, and IMUs. My contributions include real-time arterial wall tracking, pulse contour analysis, automated segmentation of arterial layers, and dynamic modeling of wave reflections — all optimized for embedded, real-time systems with minimal computational load._

---

### 5. **Translational MedTech for Primary and Preventive Care**

**Focus**: Bridging engineering and clinical practice to develop scalable, user-friendly health technologies.
> _My work emphasizes the translation of research into real-world impact. Through close clinician collaborations and iterative design, I build devices that are affordable, portable, and easy to use. From first prototypes to multi-center validations, these technologies are designed to enable preventive screening and risk stratification across diverse healthcare settings — especially where access is limited._

---

### 6. **Collaborative Research Ecosystems**

**Focus**: Accelerating innovation through interdisciplinary and multi-institutional partnerships.

> _Strong collaborations are central to my research ethos. I engage with clinicians, engineers, and global research networks — including VascAgeNet — to ensure that the technologies we develop are both clinically relevant and globally applicable. Many of my projects involve multicenter studies and field deployments, balancing scientific rigor with translational value._

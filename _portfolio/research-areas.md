Below is a snapshot of the major themes shaping my research.

---

### 1. **Early Vascular Aging (EVA) and Preventive Cardiovascular Health**

**Focus**: Shifting cardiovascular care from reactive to preventive by identifying vascular aging before symptoms appear.  
> _Early Vascular Aging (EVA) represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular risk assessment — from population-level scoring to the detection of subclinical vascular damage. My work enables personalized cardiovascular profiling by measuring early markers such as endothelial dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, and atherosclerosis — particularly useful for young or asymptomatic individuals. This supports timely, individualized interventions for long-term cardiovascular health._

### 2. **Affordable and Novel Ultrasound Technologies**

**Focus**: Designing high-speed, affordable, and compact edge systems for ultrasound-based vascular monitoring.  
> _I have expertise in developing novel ultrasound applications and systems, with a special interest in A-mode scanners. A-mode ultrasound offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional imaging systems. I have developed multichannel, multimodal A-mode platforms capable of high-speed acquisition (∼10 kFps), enabling capture of fine vessel dynamics. These systems are optimized for advanced applications like local PWV measurement and arterial hyperelasticity modeling, and are well-suited for real-time use in resource-constrained environments._

### 3. **Multimodal Biomedical Signal Acquisition Systems**

**Focus**: Instrumentation integrating multiple measurement modalities.  
> _Several pathological diagnoses, including cardiovascular diseases, are multifactorial and cannot be captured through isolated metrics. They require a combination of sensing modalities with synchronized acquisition. I design systems that unify multiple sensing modalities into a single, streamlined framework. One such example is a single platform that enables comprehensive assessment of markers — FMD, IMT, lumen diameter, central BP, and both local and regional stiffness — all within a single test._

### 4. **Advanced Signal Processing Applications**

**Focus**: Extracting clinically relevant information from raw sensor signals.  
> _I apply advanced signal processing to extract robust physiological features from diverse modalities such as radiofrequency ultrasound, blood pulse waveforms, ECG, EMG, and IMUs. Some of my contributions include the development of algorithms for real-time arterial wall tracking, pulse contour analysis, automated segmentation of arterial layers, and dynamic modeling of wave reflections — all optimized for embedded systems with minimal computational load._

### 5. **Translational MedTech for Primary and Preventive Care**

**Focus**: Bridging engineering and clinical practice to develop scalable, user-friendly health technologies.  
> _My work emphasizes the translation of research into real-world impact. Through close clinician collaborations and iterative design, I gather requirements from the field and build devices that are affordable, portable, and easy to use — but more importantly, solve indigenous problems. From first prototypes to multi-center validations, these technologies are designed to enable preventive screening and risk stratification across diverse healthcare settings — especially where access is limited._

---

### 6. **Collaborative Research Ecosystems**

**Focus**: Accelerating innovation through interdisciplinary and multi-institutional partnerships.  
> _Strong collaborations are central to my research ethos. I engage with clinicians, engineers, global research networks, and even regulatory personnel to ensure that the technologies we develop are both clinically relevant and globally applicable. Many of my projects involve clinical studies and field deployments, balancing scientific rigor with translational value._

# Impact & Recognition

---

### 🧭 Overview

> _“My research is driven by a desire to bridge lab innovation with field application — with tangible benefits in clinical, public health, and policy ecosystems.”_

### 🏥 Clinical Adoption & Validations

The work that I had been engaged in at HTIC - IIT Madras, was always validated across a range of clinical and physiological settings, demonstrating both robustness and translational potential. I have been part of several clinical studies, conducting and monitoring them, with data collected over 6000 subjects. At the Voluntary Health Services (VHS) Hospital, Chennai, the ARTSENS® Pen was clinically tested for its ability to assess carotid arterial stiffness, confirming its ease of use and reliability in point-of-care settings. In multicenter evaluations at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), ARTSENS® Plus was studied for accuracy and repeatability, validating its performance in both expert-led and minimally trained use cases. At IIT Madras, a novel method for central blood pressure estimation was validated under physiologically dynamic conditions using Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) protocols. In collaboration with the Radboud University Medical Center, The Netherlands, ARTSENS® was used in lifestyle-based vascular studies, examining the impact of sedentary behavior on arterial stiffness. At AIIMS, the technology supported investigations into baroreflex sensitivity impairments in COVID-19 survivors, linking vascular stiffness with autonomic recovery. Further preclinical validation was carried out at Palamur Biosciences, Hyderabad, using an anesthetized porcine model to study vascular pulse contour metrics under controlled blood pressure conditions. A prospective study at SDM College of Medical Sciences & Hospital, Dharwad, Karnataka, is currently exploring the role of yoga in cardiovascular modulation, where ARTSENS is used to noninvasively track vascular health over time.

### 👥 Public & Community Impact

With a strong emphasis on accessibility and scalability, my research has actively contributed to public health interventions, rural outreach, and population-level cardiovascular risk tracking. Using ARTSENS® technologies, we have conducted high-throughput vascular health screenings in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, enabling community-level detection of early vascular changes. In rural regions around Vellore, we profiled blood pressure and arterial stiffness to better understand the spread and nature of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These efforts are helping establish early-intervention pathways where objective vascular measurements, rather than risk scores alone, guide prevention strategies.

We are also contributing to multi-center vascular phenotyping studies to understand ethnic and lifestyle-driven vascular variability in the Indian population. Targeted efforts include the development of low-cost, non-invasive BP and stiffness monitors for pregnant women, with the goal of improving maternal cardiovascular health. In parallel, work is ongoing to develop home-based vascular monitoring tools, enabling individuals to track the impact of lifestyle interventions on their arterial health — making preventive cardiovascular care both actionable and personal.

#### 🔍 Highlights
{: .notice--info}
- **Community Screening**: Conducted large-scale cardiovascular screenings in Kerala and rural Tamil Nadu using portable ARTSENS® devices.  
- **Lifestyle & NCDs**: Studied the impact of lifestyle on early arterial changes in controlled groups to inform behavioral interventions.  
- **Population Studies**: Enabled vascular phenotyping in Indian cohorts through multi-center studies focused on age, sex, and lifestyle variation.  
- **Maternal Health**: Designed low-cost BP and stiffness monitors for early cardiovascular monitoring in pregnant populations.  
- **Home Monitoring**: Building affordable home-use arterial health trackers to support widespread adoption of preventive lifestyle changes.
